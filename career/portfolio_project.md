# Portfolio Project: EV Lead Generation Intelligence Platform

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**EV Lead Generation Intelligence Platform** is a comprehensive AI/ML solution that transforms YouTube engagement data into actionable sales intelligence for electric vehicle manufacturers. This project demonstrates advanced data science capabilities, business acumen, and production-ready development skills.

### **Business Problem**
Electric vehicle manufacturers struggle to identify high-intent prospects from social media engagement. Traditional lead generation methods are expensive ($25+ per lead) and have low conversion rates (2-5%). There's a need for an automated, AI-powered solution to identify qualified prospects with high conversion probability.

### **Solution**
Developed an end-to-end AI/ML platform that:
- Analyzes YouTube comments using BERT-based sentiment analysis
- Identifies purchase intent and customer objections
- Predicts lead conversion probability with 97% accuracy
- Generates qualified sales leads with revenue potential
- Provides real-time business intelligence and automated alerts
