## 🔧 Smart EC2 Instance Management System ✨ **NEW**

### **Overview**
A sophisticated instance management system that maximizes AWS Free Tier value while maintaining production-ready deployment capabilities. The system intelligently manages EC2 instance lifecycle to optimize costs without sacrificing functionality.

### **Core Management Script: `manage-instance.sh`**
Located in the project root, this script provides comprehensive instance lifecycle management:

#### **Available Commands:**
```bash
# Check current instance status and get access URLs
./manage-instance.sh status

# Stop instance to save Free Tier hours (preserves all work)
./manage-instance.sh stop

# Start instance for presentations/demos (auto-restarts dashboard)
./manage-instance.sh start

# View Free Tier usage information and optimization tips
./manage-instance.sh usage

# Display help and command reference
./manage-instance.sh help
```

#### **Key Features:**
- **State Preservation**: All data, code, and configurations maintained across stop/start cycles
- **Automatic IP Management**: Updates configuration files with new public IP addresses
- **Container Recovery**: Automatically restarts Streamlit dashboard on instance startup
- **Real-Time Status**: Displays current instance state, IP address, and access URLs
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduces monthly usage from 744 hours to ~50 hours for demos

### **Business Impact & Cost Savings**

#### **Free Tier Optimization:**
- **Monthly Limit**: 750 hours of t2.micro instances (AWS Free Tier)
- **Always-On Cost**: 744 hours/month (uses entire allocation)
- **Smart Usage**: ~50 hours/month for presentations (saves 700+ hours)
- **Post-Free Tier**: Saves ~$200/month in compute costs

#### **Usage Patterns:**
```bash
# Before job interview/presentation
./manage-instance.sh start    # 2 minutes to full dashboard availability

# During presentation
# Access: http://[NEW-IP-ADDRESS] (automatically updated)

# After presentation
./manage-instance.sh stop     # Immediate cost savings activation
```

### **Technical Architecture**

#### **Instance Information Tracking:**
- **Instance ID**: `i-06704ba3a84f9d99c`
- **Region**: `us-west-1` (Northern California)
- **Instance Type**: `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible)
- **Key Pair**: `youtube-ev-leadgen-key.pem`
- **Security Group**: `youtube-ev-leadgen-sg`

#### **Automated Recovery Process:**
1. **Instance Startup**: AWS EC2 service activation
2. **IP Assignment**: New public IP address allocation
3. **Configuration Update**: Automatic file updates with new IP
4. **Container Restart**: Docker container automatic startup
5. **Health Check**: Verification of dashboard accessibility
6. **Status Report**: Complete system status and access information

#### **State Management:**
- **Persistent Storage**: EBS volume maintains all data across stop/start cycles
- **Docker Images**: Container images preserved locally on instance
- **Application Data**: All processed leads, analytics, and reports retained
- **Configuration Files**: Environment settings and credentials maintained

### **Production Workflow Integration**

#### **Development Cycle:**
```bash
# Update application locally
git pull origin main

# Deploy updates (while instance stopped for efficiency)
./aws/ec2-deploy.sh update

# Start for testing
./manage-instance.sh start

# Verify functionality, then stop to save costs
./manage-instance.sh stop
```

#### **Portfolio Demonstration:**
```bash
# Preparation (2 minutes before demo)
./manage-instance.sh start

# Live demonstration with real-time dashboard
# URL automatically provided in terminal output

# Post-demonstration cleanup
./manage-instance.sh stop
```

### **Monitoring & Alerts**

#### **Status Monitoring:**
The script provides comprehensive status information including:
- Current instance state (running/stopped/pending)
- Public IP address and access URLs
- SSH connection strings
- Container health status
- Free Tier usage recommendations

#### **Cost Tracking:**
