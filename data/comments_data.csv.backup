Focus on recycled materials making up most of the interior. Get standard materials used by other car makers and get the price down. If you can get a sub 30k R3 model out quickly with a simplified interior and no self driving you will literally be big competition. Do not focus on the people paying big bucks for gas powered cars. That doesn‚Äôt translate to electric the people who want to go electric i feel are often wanting to do it because of COST! So get a sick low cost car out NOW!,2024-03-09T07:12:30Z

2024-03-08T02:42:53Z,@tedbellSEA,qTHDnQiAvDA,"Unanswered questions: 
1) Spare Tire (a repair kit does not cut it).  We have two friends/family members with recent flat tires on their EVs that the repair kit could not repair.  Flatbed tow and long delay resulted.  (Not good if you are out of cell service area.)  Then more wait to secure the proper replacement tire.  Please, offer a spare tire, even as an option.
2) Tow hitch with 2"" receiver.  We don't want to tow anything, but we do need a bike rack that can handle two heavy e-bikes (50-80 lbs each) with fenders and large tires . Something like 2.5M e-bikes sold in the US the past 3 years.   The bike rack industry only recently solved this problem (e.g. Colorado's QuikRStuff), and major companies such as Thule and Yakima still do not have a the perfect solution for e-bikes.  Rivian's ""bike mount"" for the R2 (shown on their website), looks laughable for securing the millions of e-bikes Americans are purchasing - especially given the failed attempts by bike rack manufacturers.",2024-03-11T11:52:17Z

Stopping me is lack of a service model (on the test drive at the service center the Rivian employee told us they sometimes have customers wait 2 months plus for appointments), Still promising a lot of things in software updates that do not exist (V2H, etc) , still no power tonneau cover,  and their corporate stability. I looked around 3 weeks ago and the announcement of how much they are losing is really disturbing. The announcement of the R2 , R3 and R3X look neat but in 2026? Why even announce it? Sounds like a ploy to get reservations so they are solicit funding to stay afloat while they try to figure it out.

2024-03-14T11:56:00Z,@MrProy33,W6-IXVVvJZM,"Lol. Just, no. Get a Mazda for 15 grand less and you'll be much better off... you'll save so much more money in the long run without ruining the electricity markets and car markets any further. Sometimes I wish I worked in a tire store so I could laugh at EV buyers when they get that sticker shock the first time...  or an insurance agent when they realize how much more expensive their EV is really gonna set em back when they factor all of the associated costs--including wasted charging time, public charger costs, and lack of resale value. 

Maybe that's why EV drivers all drive so darn slow! They get an overpriced, overweight vehicle that does 0-60 in 3 seconds, but they can't afford to let the tires get below 70% wear, they can't afford to charge at a public charger, and they can't risk a fender bender that could start a runaway battery fire, let alone risk their insurance rates getting any higher. 

To Rivian: your product is a joke to people who actually enjoy the history of cars, and for people who enjoy driving. Your pickup truck couldn't even haul my cattle trailer, so I know your other products are going to be similar:  under-designed yet overly complicated and too expensive.",2024-03-14T11:56:00Z

I think the roof height of the R1S should have been kept with the R2, and I really urge you to PLEASE RECONSIDER THE LOW ROOF HEIGHT prior to production. People like airy, boxy SUVs with high roofs. It's kinda like having a higher roof in a house, or apartment, it makes everything feel lighter and more spacious, and is more pleasant. The R1S roof was already low for the size of the vehicle. This should have a higher roof ... period. 

Also, you should make rigid, framed mosquito screens that fit the four window openings, so people can put the mosquito screens in, say the top 1/3 of the window opening, and sleep with the windows cracked in a screened environment. Obviously I have some experience camping in a car. I converted a car to sleep in the back. I also have extensive tenting experience. There is NO COMPARISON between the safety, weather-proofing, and fun things like a radio, heater, and sunroof/ power windows, and full suspension.. car camping is WAY, WAY BETTER. you get to sleep better not worrying about the issues of tent camping. 

HOWEVER... Mosquitos will instantly destroy that experience, and I don't understand in 2024 how a car company can advertise car camping without showing the mosquito nets.",2024-03-08T04:08:52Z

The R3 is typical Rivian waste. Why go into trouble making a slightly different car from the R2 at a cheaper cost.  The R3 rear hatch door is likely to have trouble as the R1T automatic bed cover-just get rid of the the dual function door.

R2, R3, R3X the beautiful siblings, at such a beautiful affordable price in America.
When he announced it starts from $45,000 , it's not only them at the event screaming woah, it's my inner voice too screaming here looking super surprised.

The white color of R2 is so beautiful, and also the sibling R3 both look beautiful and fantastic.

This event is really worth downloading and storing into my hdd.

I hope this company does perform well in global markets and expand into my country India with affordable prices just like this.

Just look at the Performance midrange phones have today. There is no need to buy a 1000$+ phone, a 300$ phone does the same things and it does those things really well, just not as fast as a flagship phone. Phone screens are another example. A few years ago only high end phones had OLED screens but now even a 200$ Motorola has a 120hz OLED Display. Graphics cards today are super fast, even the cheaper ones. But it took time to get there. EVs aren't dying. Yes, the price are fairly high today and the charging network could be improved. But this will only get better over time when good tech is getting cheaper.

2024-03-07T22:27:16Z,@iCozzh,82IiXIKkRIA,@@stevennguyen-q6r not a chance. Shiny products doesnt change the fact that theyre losing twice as much for what their cars sell for. Theyre out of cash before this thing even launches (they didnt even give a date for r3) they will need to do more capital raises whilst burning the most amount of cash we‚Äôve ever seen.,2024-06-18T03:25:33Z
