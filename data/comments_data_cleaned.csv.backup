Get a Mazda for 15 grand less and you'll be much better off... you'll save so much more money in the long run without ruining the electricity markets and car markets any further. Sometimes I wish I worked in a tire store so I could laugh at EV buyers when they get that sticker shock the first time...  or an insurance agent when they realize how much more expensive their EV is really gonna set em back when they factor all of the associated costs--including wasted charging time, public charger costs, and lack of resale value. 

Maybe that's why EV drivers all drive so darn slow! They get an overpriced, overweight vehicle that does 0-60 in 3 seconds, but they can't afford to let the tires get below 70% wear, they can't afford to charge at a public charger, and they can't risk a fender bender that could start a runaway battery fire, let alone risk their insurance rates getting any higher.

I think the roof height of the R1S should have been kept with the R2, and I really urge you to PLEASE RECONSIDER THE LOW ROOF HEIGHT prior to production. People like airy, boxy SUVs with high roofs. It's kinda like having a higher roof in a house, or apartment, it makes everything feel lighter and more spacious, and is more pleasant. The R1S roof was already low for the size of the vehicle. This should have a higher roof ... period. 

Also, you should make rigid, framed mosquito screens that fit the four window openings, so people can put the mosquito screens in, say the top 1/3 of the window opening, and sleep with the windows cracked in a screened environment. Obviously I have some experience camping in a car. I converted a car to sleep in the back. I also have extensive tenting experience. There is NO COMPARISON between the safety, weather-proofing, and fun things like a radio, heater, and sunroof/ power windows, and full suspension.. car camping is WAY, WAY BETTER. you get to sleep better not worrying about the issues of tent camping.
