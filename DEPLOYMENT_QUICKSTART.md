# Enter: Access Key, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1), Format (json)

# 4. Verify Docker is running
docker --version
```

### **Local Testing (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Test Docker build
docker build -t ev-leadgen:latest .

# Test locally (optional)
docker run -p 8501:8501 ev-leadgen:latest
# Visit http://localhost:8501 to verify
```

### **AWS Deployment (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Deploy to AWS (automated)

# - Wait for completion (~10-15 minutes)
```

### **Verification (3 minutes)**
```bash
# Test deployment
./aws/deploy.sh test

# Get deployment info
./aws/deploy.sh info
```

### **Demo & Portfolio (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Run your pipeline once for demo data
./scripts/run_full_pipeline.sh

# Take screenshots of:
# - AWS Console showing your resources
# - Cost breakdown (should be $0-5)
# - Your running application
```

### **Cleanup When Done**
```bash
# Clean up all resources to avoid charges
./aws/cleanup.sh
# Type 'DELETE' to confirm
```
